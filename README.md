You will implement your Simple Tetris game by working through exercises 220 through 223. You will have the opportunity to customize your game, as you like, but these exercises provide a basic framework for implementing your game.

Be sure to follow the Design Recipe for each function you develop.

I've given you a head-start and completed exercise 220 for you. Read through `tetris-220.rkt`, run it, and be sure you understand the code (all steps of the Design Recipe for each function) before attempting exercise 221. Each exercise will be completed in the corresponding `.rkt` file, with the code from the previous exercise as the starting point. \\ \\
